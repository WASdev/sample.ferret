Ferret [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.ferret.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.ferret)
======

This sample project contains a simple Servlet application called Ferret. Ferret listens for HTTP requests sent to `<host>:<port>/ferret[/*]`, and responds with information about the request and the server.

## Running in Eclipse

### Maven
1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Create a new Liberty Profile Server. See [step 3](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/) for details.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
5. Deploy the sample into Liberty server. Right click on the *ferret* sample and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select the Liberty profile server and press *Finish*. 
6. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/ferret](http://localhost:9080/ferret)

### Gradle
1. Go to *Help > Eclipse Marketplace > Install Buildship Gradle Integration 2.0*
2. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Gradle Project'.
3. Go to *Window > Show View > Other > Gradle Executions & Gradle Tasks*
4. Go to Gradle Tasks view and run `clean` in build folder, then `build` in build folder, then `libertyStart` in liberty folder.
5. You should see the following in the console: `Application JAXWSWebSample started in XX.XX seconds.`

## Running in the Command Line

### Maven cmd-line
This project can be build with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the Ferret sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/ferret](http://localhost:9080/ferret).

### Gradle cmd-line
The sample can be built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in]. In the directory where you cloned the repository issue the following command to build and run the project.

    $ gradle build

To start the application use the command:

    $ gradle libertyStart

To stop the application use the command:

    $ gradle libertyStop

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/ferret](http://localhost:9080/ferret).
